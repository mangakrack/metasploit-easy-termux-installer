In this text i try to solve somo errors

If you have the follow error

Failed to connect to the database: could not connect to server: Connection refused
        Is the server running on host "127.0.0.1" and accepting
        TCP/IP connections on port 5432?

To solve you have to exit of metasploit and use the follow command
pg_ctl -D /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/lib/postgresql -l logfile start


If you have this error

Could not find (a gem ) in any of the sources

Run 'bundle install' to install missing gems.

Your will try uninstall and reinstall termux
Run bundle install (the gem)
Get sure that you have 1 gb 


for another error or solution your will ask me
